# mcp-weather-server
A lightweight MCP server that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeather.org based on city names. Built with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, this tool allows LLM-based agents (like those in Cursor IDE) to retrieve current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
